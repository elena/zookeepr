* Zookeepr is using alembic in a rather unusual way, which leads to
problems. James has a work-around for this, but it is not currently in
master. The work-around can be cherry-picked, commit f77a799 from
https://github.com/iseppi/zookeepr.git on the nasty-db-import-fix branch.

To verify the fix, use the alembic history command and check that the
head revision is "This revision is a lie and should always be head".
$ alembic --config development.ini history


* Winding ID counters forward still needs to be done manually, James
suggested the following ID counters and values:
BEGIN;
SELECT setval('person_id_seq', 10000);
SELECT setval('registration_id_seq', 20000);
SELECT setval('proposal_id_seq', 30000);
SELECT setval('invoice_id_seq', 40000);
SELECT setval('payment_id_seq', 50000);
SELECT setval('payment_received_id_seq', 60000);
SELECT setval('fulfilment_group_id_seq', 70000);
SELECT setval('fulfilment_id_seq', 80000);


* As far as development is concerned, James recommended that all
development should be done on trunk and pulled into the conference
branches, rather than vice versa. This helps ensure that general
development does end up in trunk and conference-specific changes do not
(both of which have been a problem in the past).

The conference branches (CONF-dev CONF-uat CONF-prod) are private and
include things like the config files (with passwords); deployment is
then done via git.
